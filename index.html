            <p>My name is Jude Carpenter.  I'll be 23 on the 22nd of September, 2019.  In the picture to the left you can see my (then 10 month old) son Marshall, and my wife Rebecca.</p>
            <p>I'm currently working as an IT recruiter for Apex Systems, and attending a part time coding bootcamp at SMU.</p>
            <p>I spend what free time I have reading books, playing the piano, and spending time with my family.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've always had a fascination with computers since I was young.  I wanted to learn more about them naturally.  I learned quite a bit about computer hardware and as a teenager I built my first computer.</p>
            <p>The curiosity didn't really stop after that point.  I taught myself some junior level graphic design in high school as a hobby and always wanted to learn software development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually I ended up at a job where I saw the sheer demand for developers in our job market.  I did some research and decided it was time for me to learn to develop and get into the field.  I spent a few weeks doing some online coding courses, but found myself wanting a more structured system, with a schedule and a classroom.  I ended up finding out about SMU's fullstack bootcamp, and signed up as soon as I could.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My goal for the future is to gain a great understanding of Web and Application development, and keep growing my knowledge of newer technologies as they emerge.</p>
